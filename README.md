Working Prototype for Galileo Voice Tech. Python and Cordova code is uploaded, Galileo board code is pending.

1. IP Address of the server needs to be changed.
2. The VoiceToText App needs to be recompiled.
3. With the Android Phone and the server being on the same LAN and the python code running on the SAME LAN the example will work.
